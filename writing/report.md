#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

The software that I used to conduct my analysis can be found at the following site [Link](http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/index.jsp?toolName=Needleman-Wunsch). The reason why I used this tool for my analysis is that I was able to quickly input the long genetic sequences and get the results for the data.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

The two sequences for `s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta` are pretty similar genetic sequences.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

I would say that the two sequences are closely related to each other because of the high score of 29 they got for the Needleman Wunsch algorithm.

 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?

The proof that I have to suggest this claim is that the genetic sequences are similar comes from the score of 29 that was obtained at the end of the two sequence comparisons. This suggests that there's no random chance that they're related and that they have a lot of genetic overlapping.




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

#TODO


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
